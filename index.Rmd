# Summary

**_Implementing data-driven, action-oriented solutions to challenging business problems_**

I am a business-minded data scientist with demonstrated skills to infer worthy insights through data analytics and exceptional statistical predictive models. I am a proficient problem solver with more than two years of experience in software engineering within the financial and healthcare industries.

I am also a full-stack Software Engineer with a passion for cleanly written, organized, and well-tested code. I have an extraordinary passion for **Python** as a data _analysis language_.

I have experience using Javascript, Ruby, R, Java, and their frameworks. Iâ€™ve developed many applications in many languages, especially in the financial industry. My background in mechanical engineering helped me to improve my capabilities as a Software Engineer within healthcare and financial industries.

I like to learn by reading and to convey the learning skills via writing. I have a blogpost on [Medium](https://medium.com/@salmaeng71) - Kindly check it out. Many followers find it useful to them.
